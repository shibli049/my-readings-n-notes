#How to read effectively
1. Take notes while reading, try to use notebook/diary for taking notes.
2. After reading each chapters, take important notes on that chapter.
3. Write a summary of each chapter.
3. Write your opinions and learnings on this chapter.
4. Try to take note while reading. Cause:
    1. People can **remember maximum 7 things**, and
    2. People will **forget details after 5 minutes**.
